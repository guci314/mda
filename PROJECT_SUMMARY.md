# MDA Project Summary

A concise summary of the MDA repository (Model-Driven Architecture with a PIM Execution Engine).

## Purpose

- Provide a PIM (Platform Independent Model) Execution Engine that interprets and runs PIM models at runtime, removing the need for template-based code generation for many use-cases.
- Offer an optional PIM Compiler to generate production code (PSM) when needed, and integrate LLMs to assist in code generation and model understanding.

## Key Components

- `pim-engine/` — Runtime engine that loads PIM models (YAML/Markdown), generates dynamic APIs, executes business flows and rules, supports hot reload, and provides debugging interfaces.
- `pim-compiler/` — Compiler and code-generation tools (PIM→PSM→Code) and research around React Agent and LLM-assisted generation.
- `pim-ui/` — Separate web UI for model management, instance control, and debugging (runs on port 3000 by default).
- `models/` — Example PIM models for domains such as user and order management.
- `docs/` and top-level Markdown files — Design documents, implementation plans, research notes and user guides.

## Architecture (high level)

- Business users define systems as PIM models (YAML/Markdown).
- The PIM Execution Engine loads and interprets models, dynamically creating APIs, database schemas, and runtime instances.
- Optional: the PIM Compiler can generate production code when teams want a conventional deployment artifact.

## Quick start (local)

1. Start the PIM engine:

```bash
cd pim-engine
./start_master.sh
# engine on http://localhost:8000
```

2. (Optional) Start the Web UI:

```bash
cd pim-ui
npm install
npm start
# UI on http://localhost:3000
```

3. Upload or create a model under `models/` and use the generated API under `/api/v1/<domain>/...`.

## Status (as of 2025-07 and repository notes)

- Core runtime (PIM Execution Engine): implemented with FastAPI and supports dynamic API generation, model hot-reload, flow execution, and a debugging UI.
- Compiler and AI integration: prototypes and LLM-assisted generation implemented (e.g., Gemini/GPT integration). Research areas (React Agent, reinforcement learning) have working artifacts.

## Suggested next steps

- Add or update automated tests covering the engine's model loading and API generation paths (`pim-engine/tests` and `pim-compiler/tests`).
- Add CI configuration (GitHub Actions) to run tests, linting (black/isort/pyright), and basic integration checks.
- Harden deployment: docker-compose or Kubernetes manifests for engine, DB (Postgres), Redis, and UI.
- Document model schema and extension points clearly in `docs/` and the engine `README.md`.

## Where to look first

- `pim-engine/README.md` — engine-specific developer docs
- `pim-compiler/README.md` — compiler and codegen docs
- `pim-ui/README.md` — UI documentation and start instructions
- `models/` — example PIM models
- Top-level docs like `基于LLM的MDA实现方案.md` and `PIM执行引擎架构设计.md` for design rationale

## 中文简要

见上文英文摘要：

- 目的：通过 PIM 执行引擎实现模型直接运行，减少代码生成流程。
- 主要模块：`pim-engine/`（运行时）、`pim-compiler/`（编译器/代码生成）、`pim-ui/`（前端管理）。
- 快速启动：参见 `pim-engine/start_master.sh` 和 `pim-ui` 的 npm 启动流程。
- 建议：补充测试与 CI，完善部署与文档。
