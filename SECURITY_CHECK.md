# Security Check Results

## ✅ Good News
- All `.env` files are properly excluded from git tracking
- Only `.env.example` files are in version control (which is correct)
- The main `.gitignore` already includes `.env` pattern

## ✅ Fixed Issues
- Removed hardcoded API key from `pim-engine/tests/test_gemini_cli_simple.py`

## ⚠️ Important Reminders

### Before pushing to GitHub:

1. **Rotate ALL API Keys**
   Since your API keys were exposed in `.env` files during this conversation, you should rotate them:
   - DeepSeek API key
   - OpenRouter API key  
   - Gemini/Google API keys
   - SiliconFlow API key
   - Voyage API key
   - Kimi API key

2. **Verify git status**
   ```bash
   git status
   git ls-files | grep -i "\.env" | grep -v ".example"
   ```
   This should return NO results (only .env.example files should be tracked)

3. **Double-check sensitive files**
   ```bash
   # Check for any tracked files that might contain secrets
   git ls-files | xargs grep -l "sk-" 2>/dev/null | grep -v ".min.js"
   git ls-files | xargs grep -l "AIzaSy" 2>/dev/null | grep -v ".min.js"
   ```

## ✅ Repository is Safe to Push
After rotating your API keys, the repository is safe to push to GitHub because:
- No `.env` files with real credentials are tracked
- The hardcoded API key has been removed
- All sensitive files are properly gitignored

## Best Practices for the Future
1. Never commit `.env` files with real values
2. Always use `.env.example` with placeholder values
3. Consider using git-secrets or similar pre-commit hooks
4. Regularly audit your repository for exposed secrets
